# pace home exercize

Dear Thomas,
As discussed earlier, please find attached the dataset you will be using for this exercise. It would be useful if you could share any code that you use for the analysis, but don't worry too much about it: the most important part will be the 20 minute presentation (+20 minutes of questions) that you will give in the on-site. The exercise consists of a few questions. The whole thing should take you about 5-10 hours, including preparing the presentation. The third question is a bit more open ended, so feel free to just give us your thoughts about it, or more if you have the time. We look forward to hearing your solutions for them! Let me know if you have any questions. I have also sent you a calendar invite, please let me know if you have not received it yet.  

Questions:

1 Build and test a model to predict the number of sales in the future for any room and reservation night. Discuss the model and evaluate the performance

2 Build and test a model to do the same for revenue. Discuss whether and how the two models interact. 

3 Bonus points: Describe and maybe work through how you would decide how to change prices according to demand changes. How would you test that youâ€™re providing the best price recommendations?
